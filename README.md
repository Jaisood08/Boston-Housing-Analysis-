Reed Full analysis Report : ![Report](https://github.com/Jaisood08/Boston-Housing-Analysis-/blob/main/Report.pdf)

This report seeks to examine the influence of several neighbourhood attributes on the prices of housing, in an attempt to discover the most suitable explanatory variables. The specific neighbourhood attributes to be considered are proximity to the Charles River, distance to the main employment centres, pupil-teacher ratio in schools, and levels of crime. Whereas the original study focused on air pollution using nitrogen oxide concentrations as an explanatory variable, this report examines whether or not there are other, better explanatory variables for the median value of houses in Boston. The R programming language will be used to conduct this analysis
